      <h2>Why Cannoli Are So Special</h2>
      <p class="cannoli-text">
        A true gift from Sicily, the cannoli is more than a dessert — it's a symbol of celebration,
        heritage, and indulgence. Crispy fried pastry shells cradle a smooth ricotta-based filling,
        often studded with chocolate chips or candied fruit.

      <h2>History and Heart</h2>
      <p>
        Cannoli originated in the Palermo and Messina regions during the Arab rule of Sicily.
        Traditionally made for Carnival, their popularity quickly spread beyond the island.
        Each bite tells a story of generations who have passed down recipes with pride.
